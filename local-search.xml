    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the past six months, I was focusing on preparing for the entrance exam of postgraduate schools, owing to that, I could barely write posts or sorting out my blog. What’s worse, I figured out that I got my server expired and lost most of my posts that I have written in the almost past three years, in which I have made some records in my study and lives, including programming thoughts and life experiences.</p><p>As you’ll find out, I plan to migrate my blog from cloud server to git pages, it’s kind of a large project. Thanks to the exam which I have mentioned above, actually I did not expect that I could spend a surprisingly large amount of time in concentrating on one thing. It’s helpful in building up a hard-working, persistent personality.</p><p>In short, now that I’ve finished my exam, I plan to get a vacation for a couple of weeks and then back to my blog’s migration.</p>]]></content>
